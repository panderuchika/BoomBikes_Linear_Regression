# BoomBikes_Linear_Regression

You must create a multivariate linear regression model for this programming assignment's prediction of the demand for shared bikes. For the same, a Jupyter notebook must be submitted.

# Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service that makes bikes available to people for short-term, shared use that can be paid for or provided for free. Many bike share programmes enable users to pick up a bike from a "dock" that is typically computer-controlled, where they enter their payment information and the system unlocks the bike. Then, you can return this bike to a different system-affiliated dock.

Due to the ongoing Corona scandal, the US bike-sharing company BoomBikes has saw significant drops in their revenues.

# Business goal
You must use the available independent variables to model the demand for shared bikes.
